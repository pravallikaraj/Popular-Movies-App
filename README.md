# Popular-Movies-App
## Overview
This project is developed as part of my Android Developer Nanodegree program from Udacity. The App helps users to discover the popular and recent movies.
The Popular Movies app has the following features

1. Upon the launch of the app, it displays the popular movies in a grid arrangement.
2. The app allow the users to change the setting by clicking on sort by option on top right - you can sort by popular movies, top rated movies and favourite movies.
3. When the user taps on a movie poster, it navigates to the movie details page with additional information like release date, ratings and description.
4. The movie details page allows the user to play the trailer in YouTube and to view the reviews of the selected movie.
5. The movie details page also allows the user to add/delete  it to/from the favourites.
6. This app uses Room Persistence Library to store the favourite movies information locally, which help the users to view the favourite movies list when they are offline.

## How to run 
This movie app uses The Movie Database (TMDb) API. Get your API Key from the TMDP website (https://www.themoviedb.org/) and enter in the place of “enter your API key here” in NetworkUtils.java file.
